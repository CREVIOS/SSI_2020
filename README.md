## Statistics
Someone asked a question along the lines of "what should I read if I want to keep studying statistics?" My answer to this question is here. 

In statistics, there’s sort of a few directions you can go in. 

One direction is learning more about prediction problems. A pretty good resource for this are MIT’s course notes on intro to machine learning: see here, for example: https://phillipi.github.io/6.882/2020/notes/6.036_notes.pdf

If you’re interested in applications, Stanford has a few pretty good classes on this: 

http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

Another direction is learning about statistical foundations. While this is somewhat less likely to lead to research project, learning statistical foundations is, I would say, intellectually satisfying. To study statistical foundations, I would say that a good place to start is: 

https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home 

and

This is a really good book on the foundations of probability. 

A more advanced follow up to this book is here https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf  

Although this book requires a lot of knowledge, it’s really interesting too. 

Statistical Inference (https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/8131503941/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=casella+and+berger&qid=1596196019&s=books&sr=1-2) is also an interesting field, and builds more on the decision theory that we talked about. 

If you’re interested in causality, I don’t have that many recommendations, although The Book of Why (https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X) is a good resource. Perhaps the econometric literature (http://www.econometricsbooks.com/) is a good resource.
